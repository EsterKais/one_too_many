# One Too Many

## Introduction

This website was our first hackathon project after one week of learning the basics of HTML5, CSS3 and Ruby on Rails. The idea behind One Too Many was building a website that displays different types of coffeebeans and provides fruther information on them (such as origin, flavour, roast etc.). This project was done in a group of 3 and we had 2 days.
